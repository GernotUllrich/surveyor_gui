surveyor-gui?
============

Surveyor-gui complements the surveyor gem.

The surveyor gem is used to create surveys by parsing a file written in the Surveyor DSL.  It does not include a gui for creating surveys, although it does provide a gui for taking surveys.

The lack of a gui front-end limits the utility of surveyor for certain applications.

Surveyor-gui meets this need by providing a gui to create surveys from scratch.

Surveyor-gui bypasses the need to create a Surveyor DSL file, and directly updates the Surveyor tables to build a survey.
